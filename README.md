### An exploration of the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) Social Vulnerability Index (SVI) dataset

**Social vulnerability** refers to the resilience of communities when confronted by external stressors, such as:
<ul>
    <li>natural disasters</li>
    <li>human caused diasters</li>
    <li>disease outbreaks</li>
</ul>

**Socially vulnerable populations** are those who have special needs, including, but not limited to:
<ul>
    <li>people without vehicles</li>
    <li>people with disabilities</li>
    <li>older adults</li>
    <li>people with limited English proficiency</li>
</ul>

Recognizing a need to quantify this information, the United States **Centers for Disease Control** (CDC) produced the **Social Vulnerability Index** (SVI).
